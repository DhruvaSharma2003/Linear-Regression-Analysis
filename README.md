# Linear-Regression-Analysis
Linear Regression Analysis on a Wave Energy Converters Datatset, which contains the positions and absorbed power outputs of WECs in four different locations: Sydney, Adelaide, Perth, and Tasmania.
The dataset used in this analysis provides valuable information on the positions and absorbed power outputs of WECs in real world conditions. By examining this data, we aim to investigate the relationship between the positions of WECs and their corresponding absorbed power outputs
Download the "Wave Energy Converters" dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/494/wave+energy+converters).
Load the dataset into the programming 
environment i.e. Jupyter Notebook.
